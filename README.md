Peroxide Considered Changes  

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 

General 
----------------------- 
Lower cero CDs or make all of them function like matra, they are too easy to pb and punish and they already get punished buy the long CDs 

Make reitatsu regen 75% effective when you have herrio active 
 
 
Shikai 
----------------------- 
nerf flame damage 
give WOF dmg reduction similar to manifest but remove the floating in the air when using it 
buff flame pillars scaling 
increase the startup on flame wisps to stop it from being a true combo ender literally all the time and giving reaction time to higher ping players 
increase explosion CD/nerf explosion scaling 
 
 

Res 
---------------------- 
Rework musicâ€™s grenade move 
buff vessel dmg, it does nearly nothing now 
increase CDs on vessel moves 
lower manifest scaling 
make chaos form a toggle that drains rei slowly 
fix chaos blaster doing the dmg on PB 
 
Hollows 
---------------------- 
Increase the potency of vasto lorde players and consider adding additional content to let them level up and get stronger, maybe they can suck the life force of other hollow and hollow players and get stronger that way 

Grinding 
----------------------- 
Add 2 more forms of grinding: 
Bosses that you can kill similar to kisuke, maybe multiplayer for these 
Better quests in hueco/SS, add a portal for SRs that requires them to do a mini dungeon to access hueco indefinitely, similarly you can pay kisuke for a SS portal? (risk vs reward, hollows have to invade to get better quests and vice versa)
